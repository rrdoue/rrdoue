- Hi, I’m @rrdoue (Roger Ray Doue) -- I go by Ray
- I’m interested in using GitHub source control and Python to build on previous PERL and source control knowledge and experience
- I’m currently learning more about moving over to Python
- I’m unsure what to collaborate on yet, since for the most part I'm a little new at most of this.
- You can reach me via my email address here, thanks.
